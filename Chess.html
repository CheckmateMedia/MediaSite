        <div style="padding-right: 20em; font-size: large; margin-left: 25%;"><b>How the game
                works:</b><br><br>There are two rows of 8 on each side of a chess board.
            Traditionally the
            pieces are white and black, or light and dark, and the person who has the white pieces goes
            first. Each player has 6 different pieces and 16 pieces total. The weakest piece is a pawn (8 of the 16)
            and can
            only move one space at a time and can only attack forward one space, diagonally.<br><br>The most
            important piece
            one
            has is called the king and if this piece is checkmated the game is over, thus our business's
            name. The strongest and most moveable piece is the queen. It can move forwards, backwards, left and
            right, any
            number of spaces as long as there are no pieces in the way. In the graphic on the welcome page that we
            created
            for
            this site, a
            ckeck mate is pictured that was achieved with a rook and the queen each turn you may only move one
            piece.
            Traditionally a move is
            final once a player lets go of the piece, so we teach students to think and plan as long as needed
            before
            finalizing a move.<br><br><b>Chess Facts:</b> (Understand what you're
            signing up
            for.)<br><br><u>A Brief History of
                Chess:</u><br>Chess was thought to be invented invemted in the
            16th century in India, then
            spread to Persia, and then in the 15th Century chess moved to Europe and adapted into the version that
            we play
            today and the version that we teach here at Check Mate. In the 1800s chess tournaments began to be held.
            The
            first world chess championship was held in 1886. Then since the 1900s we have seen chess explode. The
            World
            Chess Federation (FIDE) was founded. Tournaments werre held to determine the best player in the world
            and then
            in 1997 a computer first beat a chess world champion.<br><br>Now let's dive into some of the greatest
            chess
            players of all time.<br>We will start with who many consider the greatest chess player of all time. His
            name was
            Bobby Fischer. He was the world chess champion from 1972-1975. Bobby was what we call a "grand master."
            At age 14
            he became the youngest U.S. champion and at age 15 he became the youngest grand master. He was also one
            of the
            only American world chess champions. Sadly he died in
            2008. Anatoly Karpov was a Russian grand master who held the title of world chess champion from
            1975–1985 and
            1993–1999. Another Russian master was Gary Kasperov. During the cold war, Russians were
            dominating
            in world chess
            cess championships. The current world chess champion who has held the title since 2013 is the
            Norwegian Magnus Carleson.<br><br><b>Resources:</b><br><br><img src="lichess-tile-wide.png"
